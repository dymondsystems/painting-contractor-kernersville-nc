<h2>About Dymond systems</h2>
<br>
Dymond Systems has been serving the Kernersville area since 2006, We specialize in interior and exterior painting in the local area. We also offer services such as siding repair, exterior trim/soffit repair, window repair, brick and foundation repair, drywall repair, popcorn ceiling removal, and many more services. Many painting contractors avoid or sub out certain work like carpentry and repair. We provide all services necessary as you would expect from a professional painting company to get the job completed and dealing with only one company.

Here are some answers to some frequently asked questions.

<h3>Are your employees qualified? </h3>
Yes, our employees are thoroughly vetted before being left alone on jobs or running a crew. In the beginning before even hiring we always check for painting experience and trustability. In the beginning we verify all references, after that, we give a written test to determine experience level and finally we do a physical test to verify that the head knowledge translates to real world painting and procedures.
<br>
<h3>What kind of paint and material do you use?</h3> 
We use any paint or material specified by the customer, but we prefer to use quality painting from sherwin williams or other providers. We try to help the customer pick the best painting for the project depending on the needs of what the job is intended to do. Whether it’s wood, exterior siding, interior trim,metal, drywall, primer, or conditioners, we always make sure the right coating products go in the right spot.

<h3>What kind of equipment do you have?</h3>
We use top quality equipment for everything we do. Stable safe ladders, clean straight brushes (not fluffy and blown out), new roller covers, clean drop clothes, clean buckets. We have specialty equipment for rigging on steep roofs, specialty spray rigs for things like cabinet painting, and other specialty and fine finish coatings.
<br>
<h3>What happens if I don’t like the work?</h3>
In the event that you are not satisfied with our work, we will do whatever it takes to make it right, even if we have to repaint the entire job. Occasionally during a paint job certain things can get missed or overlooked, and we are aware of that. So before completion every job is thoroughly inspected by a crew leader, and then a final walk through is done by the customer.
<br>
<h3>What kind of warranty do you offer?</h3>
All of our work comes with a warranty depending on the type of paint or material you elect to use. It is also determined from whether or not certain preparation work is done. Sometimes things are needed like rotten wood replacement, but the customer may not want to replace it at that time, and elect to patch instead. In that case we can't offer a warranty on that particular area and this will be outlined in your warranty information.
