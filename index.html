<h2>About Dymond systems</h2>
<br>
Dymond Systems has been serving the Kernersville area since 2006, We specialize in interior and exterior painting in the local area. We also offer services such as siding repair, exterior trim/soffit repair, window repair, brick and foundation repair, drywall repair, popcorn ceiling removal, and many more services. Many painting contractors avoid or sub out certain work like carpentry and repair. We provide all services necessary as you would expect from a professional painting company to get the job completed and dealing with only one company.

Here are some answers to some frequently asked questions.

<h3>Are your employees qualified? </h3>
Yes, our employees are thoroughly vetted before being left alone on jobs or running a crew. In the beginning before even hiring we always check for painting experience and trustability. In the beginning we verify all references, after that, we give a written test to determine experience level and finally we do a physical test to verify that the head knowledge translates to real world painting and procedures.
<br>
<h3>What kind of paint and material do you use?</h3> 
We use any paint or material specified by the customer, but we prefer to use quality painting from sherwin williams or other providers. We try to help the customer pick the best painting for the project depending on the needs of what the job is intended to do. Whether it’s wood, exterior siding, interior trim,metal, drywall, primer, or conditioners, we always make sure the right coating products go in the right spot.

<h3>What kind of equipment do you have?</h3>
We use top quality equipment for everything we do. Stable safe ladders, clean straight brushes (not fluffy and blown out), new roller covers, clean drop clothes, clean buckets. We have specialty equipment for rigging on steep roofs, specialty spray rigs for things like cabinet painting, and other specialty and fine finish coatings.
<br>
<h3>What happens if I don’t like the work?</h3>
In the event that you are not satisfied with our work, we will do whatever it takes to make it right, even if we have to repaint the entire job. Occasionally during a paint job certain things can get missed or overlooked, and we are aware of that. So before completion every job is thoroughly inspected by a crew leader, and then a final walk through is done by the customer.
<br>
<h3>What kind of warranty do you offer?</h3>
All of our work comes with a warranty depending on the type of paint or material you elect to use. It is also determined from whether or not certain preparation work is done. Sometimes things are needed like rotten wood replacement, but the customer may not want to replace it at that time, and elect to patch instead. In that case we can't offer a warranty on that particular area and this will be outlined in your warranty information.

<h3>Whys is painting your home important?</h3>
House painting is a crucial aspect of maintaining the appearance and value of your property in Kernersville, NC. A fresh coat of paint can not only make your home look more attractive but also protect it from the elements.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to house painting, there are several factors to consider, including the type of paint, color, and finish. The most common types of paint used for exterior house painting are acrylic, oil-based, and latex. Acrylic paint is the most popular choice because it is water-based, easy to clean, and dries quickly. Oil-based paint is more durable and resistant to fading, but it takes longer to dry and has a strong smell. Latex paint is also water-based, eco-friendly, and easy to clean, but it is less durable than oil-based paint.
<br>
<br>
When choosing a color for your house, it is essential to consider the surrounding landscape, the architectural style of your home, and the color of your roof and trim. Neutral colors such as white, beige, and gray are popular choices because they complement any landscape and architectural style. However, you can also choose bolder colors to make your home stand out.
<br>
<br>
The finish of the paint is another important consideration. The most common finishes are flat, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Flat finishes are best for hiding imperfections, while gloss finishes are best for highlighting details and making your home stand out. Satin and semi-gloss finishes are a good compromise between the two, providing a balance of durability and appearance.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to hiring a house painter in Kernersville, NC, it is important to choose a reputable and experienced contractor. You can ask for references and check their credentials and insurance. A good contractor will also provide a detailed estimate, including the type and brand of paint, the number of coats, and the estimated cost.
<br>
<br>
Preparing your home for painting is also an important step. This includes power washing the exterior to remove dirt and grime, scraping and sanding away any loose or peeling paint, and making any necessary repairs such as filling in holes or cracks.
<br>
<br>
During the painting process, the contractor will use a combination of brushes, rollers, and sprayers to apply the paint. It is important to note that while using sprayers can speed up the process, it can also create a mess if not done correctly. After the paint is applied, it is important to let it dry completely before applying any additional coats.
<br>
<br>
When the painting is completed, the contractor should clean up the site, dispose of any waste, and provide you with a detailed invoice. They should also touch up any areas that may have been missed during the initial paint job.
<br>
<br>
In summary, house painting is a crucial aspect of maintaining the appearance and value of your property in Kernersville, NC. Choosing the right type of paint, color, and finish, as well as hiring a reputable and experienced contractor, is essential for achieving the desired result. It is also important to prepare your home for painting, and to let the paint dry completely before applying any additional coats. With proper care and maintenance, your house will look great for years to come.
